# -Frequency-Dependent-Crosstalk-Cancellation-XTC-

This study was completed as part of the final project for the 3D Audio course at NYU Steinhardt. 

The study explores the implementation of Frequency Dependent Crosstalk Cancellation (XTC) for spatial audio
using the Matrix Inversion method in Python. A simple non-frequency dependent system is 
implemented. This system is then improved by using frequency dependent regularization both with and 
without branch based regularization. It is observed that the branch based regularization approach 
outperforms both the former approaches by resulting in a more balanced frequency response with 
better attenuation levels.
